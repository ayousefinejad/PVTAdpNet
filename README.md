# installation
Our implementation has been tested and run on Python 3.10 using the libraries from requirements.txt.

To install the libraries you can run the command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

NOTE: You should be able to use slightly different versions for the libraries than the ones we used as long as they are compatible with one another.

We tested the model on machines using: Windows 10, Windows 11, and Linux Ubuntu 20.04 operating systems. We trained the model using both an NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB VRAM and NVIDIA A100 40GB, so 24GB of VRAM should be enough to train the model.
